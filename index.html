          <h4>Hottest Pool Party</h4>
          <p><strong>Custom designed event package</strong></p>
          <p>What has now become one of the venue's signature events, I designed the Australia Day Hottest Pool Party for this 300 person rooftop venue in the capital of Australia. The concept, aesthetic, branding, design, and execution were all of my making and the event continues to sell out and receive press each year.</p>

          <h4>The Well Millennial</h4>
          <p><strong>Brand development, graphic design</strong></p>
          <p>The Well Millennial is an online collective dedicated to supporting and uplifting millennials on a quest to find success in their physical, mental, spiritual, and social wellness routines. I spearheaded the brand with a branding package designed with Illustrator and Photoshop and have launched the social media platforms. </p>

          <h4>Tulua Yoga</h4>
          <p><strong>Brand and website redevelopment</strong></p>
          <p>Tulua Yoga is a low country based yoga company focused on feminine, empowering yoga classes and pop-up events. I rebranded the company and updated the website with Squarespace as well as helped conceptualize events, social media, and marketing strategy.</p>
